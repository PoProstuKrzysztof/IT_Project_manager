# IT_Project_manager
Corporate team management application, I made for a college project. With the help of this application, the organisation will be able to assign members to a particular group with their manager, and then immediately see what the team has to do and by when it needs to be done.

It uses ASP.NET MVC architecture along with SQL and entity framework core. It's based on identity authentication.

Data should seed automatically by writing commands in Package Manager Add-Migration "name" > Update-database.

To access administrator privileges, log in using these credentials:
